Chcem vediet
============

To test the project locally on your computer you don't need any real webserver, database, nor mail
server. They are simulated by the testing environment.

Please make sure you won't push any autogenerated files to the git repository, such as your local
env/ directory or test.db and \*.pyc files.

Dependencies
------------

You need the following packages installed
 * python (ver. 2.7.x)
 * python-virtualenv

Prepare your environment
------------------------

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/martinmacko47/chcemvediet.git
$ cd chcemvediet
$ virtualenv env
$ env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
$ env/bin/python manage.py syncdb --noinput
$ env/bin/python manage.py loaddata fixtures/*
```

Run the project
---------------

 1. Run testing webserver:

    ```shell
    $ cd chcemvediet
    $ env/bin/python manage.py runserver
    ```

 2. Run testing mailserver in another shell (it will dump all incoming emails to stdout):

    ```shell
    $ cd chcemvediet
    $ env/bin/python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
    ```

 3. Navigate your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/socialaccount/socialapp/ and login as
    'admin' with password 'kalerab'. Then click on 'Google OAuth' and enter your Google Apps
    'Client id' and 'Secret'. Similarly enter your secrets for LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.
    Don't forget to logout from the admin interface.

 4. Now, you can navigate your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and start using it.
