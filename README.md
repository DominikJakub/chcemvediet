Chcem vediet
============

To test the project locally on your computer you don't need any real webserver, database, nor mail
server. They are simulated by the testing environment.

Please make sure you won't push any autogenerated files to the git repository, such as your local
env/ directory or test.db and \*.pyc files.

Dependencies
------------

You need the following packages installed
 * python (ver. 2.7.x)
 * python-virtualenv

Prepare your environment
------------------------

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/martinmacko47/chcemvediet.git
$ cd chcemvediet
$ virtualenv env
$ env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
$ env/bin/python manage.py syncdb --noinput
$ env/bin/python manage.py loaddata fixtures/*
```

Run the project
---------------

 1. Run testing webserver:

    ```shell
    $ cd chcemvediet
    $ env/bin/python manage.py runserver
    ```

 2. Run testing mailserver in another shell (it will dump all incoming emails to stdout):

    ```shell
    $ cd chcemvediet
    $ env/bin/python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
    ```

 3. Navigate your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/socialaccount/socialapp/ and login as
    'admin' with password 'kalerab'. Then click on 'Google OAuth' and enter your Google Apps
    'Client id' and 'Secret'. Similarly enter your secrets for LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.
    Don't forget to logout the admin interface afterwards.

 4. Now, you can navigate your browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and start using it.

Site Content Administration
---------------------------

In order to administrate the site content you will need to login as the admin. Navigate your
browser to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and login as 'admin' with password 'kalerab'. You may
administer the site directly in the backend administration interface, or you may use the frontend
administration interface. To open the frontend administration interface click on 'Frontend
Administration' link in the top-right corner of the backend administration interface.

You can administer three kinds of content on the site:

 1. **CMS pages**. CMS pages are pages with static content like the site homepage or the page about
    the project. In order to administrate their content, login as the admin, open the frontend
    administration interface and navigate to the page you want to change. You will see a small
    white '+' icon in the top-right corner of the page. Click it to open the CMS Toolbar, and
    enable CMS Edit Mode. In CMS Edit Mode, you can edit all page content but its title. To change
    page's title click `Admin` / `Page settings` menu item in the top-right page corner to open the
    settings screen, where you can configure several page properties. Please, don't mess it up.
    Don't forget to publish the page after you finish editing it.

    Alternatively, you can administrate the pages directly in the backend administration interface.
    See http://127.0.0.1:8000/en/admin/cms/page/ .

 2. **CMS content on application pages**. Application pages, besides their generated content,
    contain lots of static content as well. You can edit it using the same frontend administration
    interface you edited CMS pages with. However, using the frontend administration interface you
    can only edit pages visible to the logged-in user. Therefore, for instance, you may not edit
    the `Sign In` page here. Nonetheless, you may use the backend administration interface to edit
    them. See http://127.0.0.1:8000/en/admin/chunks/chunk/ where you can find all CMS chunks used
    by application pages.

 3. **Generated content on application pages**. The content generated by the application may only
    be changed in the application itself. To change the english translation, edit the application
    code and/or templates directly. To change the slovak translation, edit the localization *.po
    file stored in the `locale` directory.

    After you alter the application code, please regenerate the localization file:
    ```shell
    $ cd chcemvediet/chcemvediet
    $ ../env/bin/python ../manage.py makemessages -l sk
    ```
    Update the localization *.po file stored in `locale` directory and compile it:
    ```shell
    $ cd chcemvediet/chcemvediet
    $ ../env/bin/python ../manage.py compilemessages
    ```
    If you only change the localization *.po file, please, don't regenerate it, just compile it.

To upstream the changes you have done, you need to push them to the git repository. If you altered
the application code, template, and/or localization files, push them directly to the repository.
However, if you edited the CMS content, you will need to prepare fixtures that will be able to
reconstruct your CMS database and upstream them. To prepare the fixtures write;
```shell
$ cd chcemvediet
$ env/bin/python manage.py dumpdata --indent=2 cms text plaintext variable chunks > fixtures/cms.json
```
Before pushing the new fixtures to the git repository, please, check if they regenerate the
database correctly.
