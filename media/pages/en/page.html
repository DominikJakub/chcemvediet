<h2>What and how?</h2>
<p>An ordinary user does not have time to study the law, does not know the exact legal periods
and the necessary formalities. We want to enable sharing of the know -how in this area - if
someone is able to obtain information of a specific type, it can help and encourage the others to
request the same information . It is also possible through the acquired data, which will help
inform citizens and reduce the burden on officials .</p>
<p>Through requests for information you can obtain the information that the institution posseses
. You do not need to justify the reason&nbsp; -- anyone can request the information. However, it
is not possible to obtain</p>
<ul>
  <li>other people's personal information , or confidential information - these are censored out
  from the institution's answer</li>
  <li>the institution is not required to "produce" the information, only look for it. It is, for
  example, not obliged to prepare an analysis if such an analysis does not exist</li>
  <li>do not use this for complaints - it is a different proces (according to a different
  law)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To describe what you are asking for. This can be a description, such as "Leasing contract
  of the object at 1 Ruzova St. " </li>
  <li>If you know the exact document number, it is good to put it into the application (but it is
  not obligatory).</li>
  <li>To know, who are you requesting the information from.</li>
  <li>It is necessary to provide your "snail" mail address: In case of a negative decision, the
  decision is always sent in a paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a digital signature/certificate</li>
  <li>any specific form</li>
</ul>
