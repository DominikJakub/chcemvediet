<p>
By using FOIA request you can obtain information that the institution has available. You do not need to justify the purpose of your request or how you will use the information. Everybody can request the information.</p>
<p>
However:
<ul>
<li> other people's personal information, or confidential information will be not provided. The request will be denied, or in case, that a document you requested contains some of the sensitive information, it will be censored out.</li>
<li>The institution is not required to "produce" the information. It is obliged to provide only the information it already has available. For example, the institution is not obliged to create any type of analysis or summaries.</li>
<li>Do not use FOIA request to raise a complaint. There is a different procedure (described in Law on complaints) for that. By using the correct process, you can also get a much better result</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You need:
<ul>
<li>To describe in sufficient detail what are you requesting. This can be a description such as "Lease contract for the object on the Rose Street 1 for the year 2010". It you know a reference number of the document, please include it: It will speedup the search and the direct reference can make your request more successfull; but it is not required.</li> 
<li>You must select which insitution you are directing your request to. Think about which institution has the information you need.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
