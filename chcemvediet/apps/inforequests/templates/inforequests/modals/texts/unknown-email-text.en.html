<p>You are about to mark this email as related, but you are not able to decide which from the options is a correct one.</p>
<strong>Example: </strong><p>You received an email, which is complicated, and you are not able to classify it or understand.</p>
<p>Using this option you can ask admin for help. However, this will take some time.
<p>
<strong>If you are really decided to ask for help even for the price you will wait, mark the email as uknown. If you instead want to try to decide from the previous options, close this window and return to see other possibilities. </strong>
