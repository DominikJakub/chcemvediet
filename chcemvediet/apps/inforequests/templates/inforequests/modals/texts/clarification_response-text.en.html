<p>If the insitution asks for clarification, you must reply in the indicated period. Otherwise your request will be discarded. Sometimes it is necessary to clarify what exactly you are asking for -- especially in the case that the formulation in your request was not exact to find the requested document.x </p>
<p>
Thanks to our portal all required formalities were included in the request, such as your name and address. Therefore, the institution should not ask about these details. They should not ask you for an (electronic) signature as well, or want you to state the reason why you need the requested information.
