<p>I have received a letter where at least a part of information was provided.</p>
<strong>Example: </strong><em>"Please find enclosed the the requested documents."</em>
Or in Slovak: <em>"V prílohe tohto listu Vám zasielame  požadované dokumenty."</em>
<p>
<strong>If you letter looks like this one, please mark it as an disclosure. Please also set the level of information, which was provided. If it is not similar, please go back and select another option. </strong>
</p>
<p>Use the option "No disclosure" if the institution said they do not have the information.</p>
