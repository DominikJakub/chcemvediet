If you think the refusal to provide the information was not right, you can appeal. Similarly, you can appeal if the deadline for the institution passed without them providing the information nor the resolution, although the insititution is obliged to do so. 
</p>
<p>
Try to explain, why the decision was not right. It will be useful to use citations from the law focused on the reasons, which were stated in the resolution. For example, if the stated reason was "trade secret", you may argue that the requested information is not a trade secret because it does not satisfy the definition prescribed by law.

If the institution did not issue an resolution, although they were obliged to do so, a specific term, so-called "fictive resolution", is used. This is the resolution you appeal against. Fictive resolution is always invalid.

<strong>
The appeal must be always in writing, i.e. by snail mail, and signed. </strong> (we did not made that up, really)
